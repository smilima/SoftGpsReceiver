# Software GPS Receiver (Qt)

A post-processing GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1 receiver for recorded IF sample files. It is built to show every
step of the signal processing: raw-signal statistics, C/A code generation, acquisition, tracking loops, bit
synchronisation, navigation-message decoding with parity or CRC, ephemeris/almanac/health, satellite orbits,
pseudoranges, and the least-squares position/velocity/time solution. GPS and Galileo can be used alone or
combined in one fix.

## What to install

Only Qt is needed to build the receiver and process recordings. The radio drivers are loaded when live mode starts, so
each one is needed only for its radio.

| What | Needed for | Where it goes | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qt 6 for MinGW 64-bit, with the MinGW compiler, CMake and Ninja | building | the Qt installer's folder | <https://www.qt.io/download> |
| UHD | live mode from a USRP | its installer's folder, `C:\Program Files\UHD` | <https://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd/> |
| `hackrf.dll` and `libusb-1.0.dll` | live mode from a HackRF One | `third_party/hackrf/windows_x64/` | built from the HackRF sources: [Getting hackrf.dll](#getting-hackrfdll) |
| `sm_api.dll` | live mode from a Signal Hound SM200 | `third_party/signal_hound/windows_x64/` | the [Signal Hound SDK](https://signalhound.com/software/signal-hound-software-development-kit-sdk/) |
| Microsoft HTML Help Workshop | the help file, `SoftGpsReceiver.chm` | `C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop` | no longer offered by Microsoft |
| Python 3 with NumPy and Pillow | only redrawing the icon (`resources/make_icon.py`) | | <https://www.python.org/>, then `pip install numpy pillow` |

* **Qt.** Only Qt Base's modules are used (Core, Gui, Widgets, Concurrent and Network), so no add-ons are needed. The
  receiver was written with Qt 6.11.2 and MinGW 13.1, in a static build of Qt, whose programs run on their own. The
  installer's Qt is a shared build: the programs run from Qt Creator, and to run one anywhere else,
  `windeployqt SoftGpsReceiver.exe` copies Qt's DLLs next to it.
* **UHD** was 4.11.0 here. The receiver finds `uhd.dll` through `UHD_PKG_PATH`, in `C:\Program Files\UHD\bin` and on
  `PATH`, or *Settings > Live* gives its path. [Setting up the N200](#setting-up-the-n200) covers the radio itself.
* **HackRF.** `third_party/` holds nothing in git, so create the folder. One `hackrf.dll` serves SoftGpsReceiver and
  GPSSim both. Windows 10 and later install the WinUSB driver a HackRF needs.
* **Signal Hound.** Its licence restricts sharing the SDK's files, so `third_party/signal_hound/` is kept out of git. From the SDK, copy `device_apis/sm_series/lib/windows/vs2019_ver_<version>/x64/sm_api.dll` (2.3.10 here), or
  give its path in *Settings > Live*. The SM200's own driver and firmware are on its
  [download page](https://signalhound.com/support/product-downloads/sm200a-downloads/).
* `uhd.dll` and `sm_api.dll` are built with Visual C++: if one will not load, install the
  [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) for
  x64.
* CMake looks for the DLLs in `third_party/` when it configures, so run CMake again after adding them (*Build > Run
  CMake* in Qt Creator). The build then copies them next to the programs.
* **HTML Help Workshop.** Microsoft no longer offers its installer, `htmlhelp.exe`. Without it CMake reports *HTML Help
  Workshop not found* and builds everything else, and *Help* says the file is missing.
* **Recordings** are not in git either. `GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin` and
  `GPS_and_GIOVE_A-NN-fs16_3676-if4_1304.bin` come with the data of the textbook *A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo
  Receiver* (Borre, Akos et al.), `IFEN_Bands-L1.stream` is from the ION sample data (see
  [Results with Galileo](#results-with-galileo)), and the simulated GLONASS and Galileo recordings are made by the
  tests. Put them in the folder that holds the checkout, where the program finds one by itself.

## Building and running in Qt Creator

1. Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator (*File > Open File or Project*).
2. Select a Qt 6 MinGW 64-bit kit (see [What to install](#what-to-install)).
3. Choose the **Release** build configuration and press **Run** (Ctrl+R).
   Debug builds also work: the DSP core (`gnsscore`) is optimised even in Debug
   (option `GNSS_OPTIMIZE_CORE_IN_DEBUG`), so only the GUI is unoptimised.
4. On first start the program looks for a large `*.bin` file in the working directory and up to five levels above
   the executable, so `GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin` is opened automatically. Otherwise use
   *File > Open*. After that the last file is reopened, unless you closed it.
5. Press **F5** (*Run all*), or run the stages one at a time with F6 (acquire), F7 (track), F8 (decode) and F9 (solve).
6. *File > Close recording* (Ctrl+W) closes the file and clears all results, plots and sample buffers, leaving the
   program as it was when it started. It is available when nothing is running, and works on a stopped live stream too.

The sampling frequency, IF and sample format come from the file name (`fs38_192` = 38.192 MHz,
`if9_55` = 9.55 MHz, int8 real samples by default, packed 2-bit real samples if the name contains `2bit`). You can
change them in *File > Settings*, along with every acquisition, tracking-loop and navigation parameter.

*File > Settings* also selects **GPS + Galileo**, **GPS only** or **Galileo only**. Searching for Galileo adds several
seconds to acquisition, so choose GPS only for a recording made before Galileo was operating.

Galileo satellites are named E and a number, such as E24, while GPS satellites go by their PRN. The Overview, Live and
Acquisition tables have a *System* column, and the bar charts continue from the GPS PRNs into E01 to E36. On the sky plots
GPS satellites are circles, Galileo satellites squares and GLONASS satellites triangles, with a count of each in the corner.

### GLONASS

GLONASS L1OF is supported for recordings on its own band, near 1602 MHz, as *GLONASS only*: a file with `glonass` in its
name selects this by itself, and its IF is that of frequency channel 0. Satellites are named by channel, such as R-3.
`tests/gen_glonass.cpp` (built with `-DGNSS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`) writes a simulated recording of made-up satellites.
This has only been tested on simulated signals, and the code and message layout still need checking against a real
recording. Times in a GLONASS solution are GLONASS seconds of the day, and GLONASS cannot yet be combined with GPS in one fix.

The file name gives the IF rounded to 9.55 MHz. The true IF of this recording is fs/4 = 9.548 MHz. The receiver
copes either way, and the Position page reports the measured *effective IF* (9.547984 MHz) from the
Doppler/clock-drift solution. If you set the IF to 9.548 MHz, the Doppler values are shown without the
2 kHz offset.

## Live mode: USRP N200

Besides recordings, the receiver can process samples as they arrive from a USRP (written for the N200; other USRPs
that UHD supports should work too). Everything updates while it runs: a **Live** tab shows the radio, the channels and
the position, and whichever other page is open keeps refreshing, so the tracking loops, navigation message, orbits and
least-squares solution can all be watched on the running signal.

![Live page](docs/screenshots/23_Live.png)

### Setting up the N200

1. Install UHD from <https://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd/>. The program looks for `uhd.dll` in `UHD_PKG_PATH`,
   `C:\Program Files\UHD\bin` and `PATH`, or you can give its path in *Settings > Live*. UHD is loaded when you start,
   so the program builds and runs without it.
2. Connect the N200 to a **wired gigabit Ethernet** port. Give that port a static address such as 192.168.10.1 with mask
   255.255.255.0 (the N200 ships as 192.168.10.2). Wi-Fi cannot carry this stream.
3. Check the radio with UHD's own tools. The N200's firmware and FPGA image must match the UHD version;
   `uhd_usrp_probe` says so if they do not.

   ```
   uhd_find_devices
   uhd_usrp_probe --args addr=192.168.10.2
   ```

4. The daughterboard must cover 1575.42 MHz (DBSRX2, WBX, SBX and UBX do). An active GPS antenna needs DC power:
   check whether your daughterboard supplies it, and use a bias tee if not.

### Running it

Set the address, sample rate and gain in *Settings > Live*, then press **F10** or *Start live* on the Live tab. Defaults
are `addr=192.168.10.2`, 5 MS/s at 1575.42 MHz and 30 dB. Each radio's settings sit in a group of their own on that
tab: tick a group's title to show them. The group of the chosen live source opens by itself.

* **First fix** takes about 30 to 60 s: a receiver with no stored data has to read a whole orbit from each satellite.
  Satellites are found within seconds, and the channel table shows each one's progress.
* **Gain:** watch *Signal level* on the Live tab, which warns when the level is too high or low.
* **Sample rate:** GPS works from 2 MS/s, Galileo needs 4 MS/s. The N200 offers 100 MHz divided by an integer, and the
  program uses the rate the device reports.
* **Overflows** (samples lost on the way to the computer) are counted on the Live tab. The gap is filled so later
  samples stay at the right time and the loops coast across it. Adding `recv_buff_size=50000000` to the device address
  can help, and so can using a lower sample rate.
* **Examining a page:** tick *Freeze pages* to stop the display while the receiver keeps running. Plots you zoom keep
  their zoom across updates; double-click to release it.
* **Recording:** tick *Record the samples to disk* in *Settings > Live* (20 MB/s at 5 MS/s). The file name carries
  the rate and format, so *File > Open* processes it later like any recording.

The tracking pages show the last 60 s and the Position pages the last 10 minutes (both adjustable). Long sessions use
constant memory.

### HackRF One

Choose *HackRF One* as the *Live source*. It uses the centre frequency and sample rate above (2 to 20 MS/s), and has
gains of its own: LNA 0 to 40 dB in steps of 8, VGA 0 to 62 dB in steps of 2, and a 14 dB RF amplifier. The defaults
are LNA 32 and VGA 40 with the amplifier off. Like UHD, `hackrf.dll` is loaded when live mode starts.

```bash
gnss_cli --hackrf --antenna-power --amp --lna 32 --vga 40 --rate 2.5e6 --ppm -10.6 --seconds 120
```

With an active patch antenna seeing part of the sky, those settings tracked 4 satellites at about 40 dB-Hz and gave a
fix 28 s after starting.

* **Antenna power** puts 3.3 V on the antenna port, for an active antenna. Leave it off with a cable to another radio,
  a simulator or a signal generator: the DC would go into it.
* **Crystal error.** A HackRF One without a TCXO is good to about 20 ppm, 30 kHz at L1: more than the default
  +/-10 kHz search. Measure it once: widen the search (`--search 40000`, or the acquisition search band in *Settings*),
  compare the Doppler found with the true one, and enter the difference as *HackRF crystal error*, positive when the
  HackRF runs fast. The tuning and the sample rate are then corrected. The HackRF this was written with ran 10.6 ppm
  slow against an N200, and drifted by a few tenths of a ppm as it warmed up.
* **Level.** The samples have 8 bits, and the satellites sit below the noise, so the noise has to span a few steps of
  the converter: the Live tab says *gain low* below about -27 dBFS. Its reading leaves out the HackRF's DC offset,
  which is worth about -30 dBFS on its own. With LNA 32 and VGA 20 an antenna's noise is half a step and nothing is
  found.
* **Amplifier.** Turn it on when the antenna's noise is not well above the HackRF's own. Switching the antenna power
  on and off shows it: the noise should rise by several dB with the power on. With the amplifier off it rose 2 dB for
  the antenna used here and no satellites were found; with it on, 8 dB, and 4 satellites.

With GPSSim on an N200 at 0 dB, through a cable into the HackRF at LNA 32 and VGA 30, all 9 satellites were tracked
and the fix kept within 1.6 m (CEP50) of the simulated position.

#### Getting hackrf.dll

The HackRF project ships no Windows build of its library, so `hackrf.dll` is built from its sources with the kit's
MinGW. It runs with UHD's `libusb-1.0.dll` (1.0.29 with UHD 4.11), and is compiled against libusb's header of the same
version. Without UHD, take `libusb-1.0.dll` from the Windows binaries of a libusb release,
<https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases>, and give its folder to `-L` below.

1. In an empty folder, get the HackRF sources and libusb's header. The tag is the version of `libusb-1.0.dll`, which
   the DLL's *Properties > Details* shows:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.0.29 https://github.com/libusb/libusb
   ```

2. With the kit's MinGW on `PATH` (`C:\Qt\Tools\mingw1310_64\bin`), build it in that folder:

   ```bash
   gcc -O2 -shared -Ihackrf/host/libhackrf/src -Ilibusb/libusb hackrf/host/libhackrf/src/hackrf.c -o hackrf.dll -L"C:/Program Files/UHD/bin" -l:libusb-1.0.dll -static-libgcc -Wl,-Bstatic -lwinpthread -Wl,-Bdynamic
   ```

3. Copy `hackrf.dll` and `C:\Program Files\UHD\bin\libusb-1.0.dll` into `third_party/hackrf/windows_x64/` and run CMake
   again. The build copies them next to the programs. The HackRF must use the WinUSB driver, which Windows 10 and later
   install for it.

### Trying it without a radio

Set *Live source* to *Replay the open recording in real time* in *Settings > Live*: the open file then behaves like a
stream, with no hardware or UHD.

The USRP code itself can be tested through `tests/fake_uhd`, a stand-in `uhd.dll` that streams a file and can simulate
lost packets and signal loss. It is built with `-DGNSS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`.

## Editing the GUI in Qt Designer

Every page, the main window and the settings dialog are `.ui` forms in `src/gui/`:

| Form | Content |
|---|---|
| `MainWindow.ui` | menus, toolbar, log dock, and the tab widget holding all pages (each tab is a promoted page widget) |
| `SettingsDialog.ui` | input, acquisition, tracking and navigation settings |
| `OverviewPage.ui` | recording info, pipeline status, satellite summary, position summary, algorithm documentation |
| `RawSignalPage.ui` | time-domain samples, ADC histogram, Welch PSD, spectrogram, statistics |
| `CaCodePage.ui` | G1/G2/C-A sequences, autocorrelation, cross-correlation, sampled correlation peak, code spectrum, code table |
| `AcquisitionPage.ui` | metric and C/N0 bars, results table, correlation surface heat map, code/Doppler slices, fine-frequency spectrum |
| `TrackingPage.ui` | 12 per-channel loop plots, all-channel overlays, multi-correlator shape, loop design tables |
| `BitSyncPage.ui` | transition histogram, prompt with bit edges, soft bits, preamble correlation, raw bit grid |
| `NavMessagePage.ui` | subframe list, words with parity check, colour-coded bit map, decoded fields with scaling and interpretation |
| `EphemerisPage.ui` | ephemeris table, almanac, health/A-S/configuration, iono/UTC, special message, NMCT, received pages |
| `SatellitesPage.ui` | sky plot, elevation, sub-satellite points, satellite state, step-by-step Kepler computation |
| `MeasurementsPage.ui` | per-epoch pseudorange corrections table, PR change, residuals, code-minus-carrier, Doppler, tropo, SV clock |
| `LivePage.ui` | live dashboard: radio status, channel table, signal strength, sky plot, recent fixes |
| `PositionPage.ui` | summary, scatter/ENU/clock/DOP/velocity plots, solutions table, least-squares iterations, H and Q matrices |

Notes for editing:

* The plots and tables are **promoted widgets**: `gui::PlotWidget` and `gui::SkyPlotWidget` (from `QWidget`) and
  `gui::DataTable` (from `QTableWidget`). You can move, resize, split or regroup them freely.
* Plot titles and axis labels are dynamic properties of the promoted widget (`title`, `xLabel`, `yLabel`, plus
  `aspectLocked` and `legendVisible`). Edit them in the Property Editor. Some titles are replaced at run time
  with PRN-specific text.
* Keep the **objectName** of any control the code uses (e.g. `channelCombo`, `epochSpin`, `surfacePlot`). The code
  accesses them as `ui->name`.
* Table **column headers are set in code** (`setColumns(...)` in each page's constructor), because the code fills
  the table by column index. Change the header list and the matching `setNum/setText` column numbers together.
* The combo boxes in `SettingsDialog.ui` list their items in enum order (sample format, Doppler sign, constellations). Keep that order.

Plot interaction: mouse wheel zooms (Ctrl = x only, Shift = y only), left-drag box-zooms, right-drag pans,
double-click resets, and right-click opens a menu (copy/save image, export CSV, legend, grid). The tracking-page
time axes are linked. Tables support Ctrl+C and *Export to CSV* from the context menu.

## Command line

```
gnss_cli <file.bin> [--ms N] [--channels N] [--fs Hz] [--if Hz] [--gnss all|gps|gal] [--csv solutions.csv]
SoftGpsReceiver <file.bin> --screenshots <dir>   # process, save a PNG of every page and sub-tab, exit

gnss_cli <file.bin> --live [--speed X] [--seconds N]    # play a recording in real time
gnss_cli --usrp [--args addr=192.168.10.2] [--rate 5e6] [--gain 30] [--antenna RX2] [--record dir] [--seconds N]
```

## Results for the sample recording

`GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin` is 50.08 s of 4-bit-quality int8 real samples.

* 9 satellites acquired (PRN 3, 6, 9, 15, 18, 21, 22, 26, 29). All tracked with 100 % phase lock at 42–51 dB-Hz.
* 63 subframes decoded, 630/630 words pass parity, and all 9 ephemerides complete and consistent.
* 99 fixes (every 0.5 s): **40.00802° N, 105.26270° W, h = 1634 m** (Boulder, Colorado), with σ E/N/U =
  1.95/2.08/3.27 m and PDOP 1.65.
* GPS week 297 (mod 1024), i.e. 2005-05-07 19:10 UTC.
* Sample clock error +10.4 ppb (clock-bias slope 3.1 m/s). Effective IF 9.547984 MHz.
* Subframe 4 page 18 (ionosphere/UTC) is broadcast every 12.5 min and is not in this 50-s recording, so no
  ionospheric correction is applied (residual RMS ≈ 5 m).

Processing the whole file takes about 13 s on a 12-core CPU: acquisition 2 s, tracking 9 s with one thread per channel.
With Galileo enabled, the search for it adds several seconds to acquisition.

## Results with Galileo

The GPS-only recordings above cannot exercise Galileo. The test recording is `IFEN_Bands-L1.stream` from the
[ION GNSS SDR sample data](https://sdr.ion.org/api-sample-data.html): 18.6 minutes of packed 2-bit real samples at
20.48 MHz with an IF of 5.5 MHz. It is not part of this repository. Save it as
`IFEN_Bands-L1-fs20_48-if5_5-2bit.stream` and those settings are read from the name.

The file's metadata gives 2016-01-19 at a fixed position. The navigation data shows that it was recorded on
2017-02-06, near 48.08 N, 11.64 E, and that the receiver was in a vehicle moving at up to 14 m/s for much of the time.

* 8 GPS and 5 Galileo satellites acquired (E02, E08, E19, E20, E30). E1-B and E1-C agree on delay and Doppler for all five.
* 1860 of 2046 I/NAV words pass the CRC, with no TOW inconsistencies. The failures come from lost tracking, mostly late
  in the recording, not from random errors.
* E20 broadcasts only dummy words (type 63), so it is tracked and decoded but gives no ephemeris. The other four share
  IODnav 91.

For the first 58 s, while the vehicle is stationary:

| Satellites | Latitude | Longitude | Height | std E/N/U | PDOP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 GPS | 48.0781398 | 11.6383598 | 601.73 m | 1.83 / 2.18 / 6.53 m | 1.88 |
| 4 Galileo | 48.0781221 | 11.6383477 | 598.52 m | 1.77 / 2.98 / 1.85 m | 2.28 |
| 8 GPS + 4 Galileo | 48.0781303 | 11.6383537 | 600.19 m | 1.44 / 2.00 / 4.24 m | 1.39 |

The two independent solutions agree to about 3 m. The Galileo-GPS bias is 2.0 m, in line with the broadcast time offset of
3.8 ns plus the different receiver delays of the two signals. Comparing the Galileo-only and GPS-only tracks epoch by epoch
over the first 710 s, including driving, gives a mean difference of less than 1 m horizontally and 3.6 m vertically, and RMS
differences of 2.8 m east and 3.4 m north. Galileo-only fixes are available for about 1000 of those 1420 epochs.

After about 710 s every satellite weakens at once, at all elevations, most likely from obstructions along the route, and the
weakest signals are lost. No Galileo-only fix is possible from then on: of the Galileo satellites only E30 and E20 stay
tracked, and E20 has no ephemeris. The receiver has no outlier rejection, so the GPS and combined solutions then show 60 to
80 jumps of up to about 100 m. There are none before that point.

The whole recording takes about 3 minutes on a 12-core CPU and 6.5 GB of memory, most of it for the per-epoch tracking
history. Limit *Data to process* for a quicker run.

### Adding simulated Galileo satellites to a GPS recording

`tests/add_galileo.cpp`, built with `-DGNSS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, makes a recording that exercises Galileo from one that has
none. It takes an int8 real recording and writes a new one:

```
add_galileo <in.bin> <out.bin> [--sats 6] [--cn0 47] [--isb 3]
```

It solves the recording with GPS, then computes E1-B and E1-C signals for made-up satellites in a Walker 24/3/1
constellation, arriving as they would at that position on that receiver's clock. They carry a full I/NAV message apart
from the almanac. `--cn0` is the strength at the zenith, and `--isb` is the Galileo-GPS time offset in metres.

The samples are multiplied by a whole number first, because a signal well under one count would otherwise disappear
when rounded. The GPS signals are unchanged, but the raw signal pages and signal levels show the larger scale.

Results from `GPS_Data_NordNav1e_fs16_3676-if4_1304.bin` with the default settings:

| Satellites | Latitude | Longitude | Height | std E/N/U |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 GPS, original file | 32.59086653 | -85.48919624 | 178.98 m | 2.73 / 2.63 / 5.87 m |
| 6 Galileo | 32.59086767 | -85.48919626 | 179.01 m | 0.66 / 1.09 / 1.55 m |
| 6 GPS + 6 Galileo | 32.59086694 | -85.48919640 | 178.98 m | 1.58 / 1.14 / 3.26 m |

This tests the receiver chain and is not evidence of Galileo accuracy. The simulated signals have no multipath,
ionosphere or front-end filtering, which is why their scatter is so small, and they take their position from the GPS
solution and use the receiver's own orbit and atmosphere code, so agreement between the rows is expected.

## Results with GLONASS

No real GLONASS recording has been tried yet. These results are from `GLONASS_sim-fs10-if0-int8iq.bin`, made by
`tests/gen_glonass.cpp`: 90 s of complex int8 samples at 10 MS/s centred on 1602 MHz, with five made-up satellites at
46 dB-Hz, white noise, a troposphere delay and a receiver clock error. The true position is 40 N, 105 W, 1600 m.

| Run | First fix | Fixes | Mean error E / N / U | Scatter E / N / U |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Batch | | 178 | 0.01 / 0.11 / 0.32 m | 4.43 / 3.31 / 8.03 m |
| Real-time replay | 23.1 s | 178 | 0.01 / 0.08 / 0.25 m | 4.30 / 3.41 / 8.27 m |

* All five satellites (R-5, R-2, R+0, R+1, R+3) were acquired with no false channels, at a measured 45.2 to 46.0 dB-Hz.
* All 44 strings on each satellite passed the Hamming check.
* PDOP is 3.17: five satellites give weak geometry, which accounts for much of the scatter.

The generator and receiver share the same code, message and orbit routines, so this shows that the chain works
end to end, not that it matches real satellites.

![Tracking - all channels](docs/screenshots/06_Tracking_All_channels.png)

**Correlator shape:** the correlation function recomputed with a bank of correlators from the stored NCO
state, showing the peak rounded by the front-end filter, with the loop's early/prompt/late points on it.

### Bit sync & data bits
Histogram of prompt sign transitions modulo 20 ms, prompt I with the detected bit edges, the soft bits and their
distribution, the bit stream correlated with the preamble (parity-verified subframe starts in red), and the raw
bit grid.

![Bit sync and data bits](docs/screenshots/09_Bit_sync__data_bits.png)

### Navigation message
Every decoded subframe (TOW, page, parity, polarity, flags). For the selected subframe: each word with its
received and computed parity, a colour-coded map of the 300 bits by field, and every field with raw bits, scale
factor, value, units and interpretation.

### Ephemeris, almanac & health
Broadcast ephemeris and clock parameters for all satellites, decoded almanac pages, satellite health from
subframe 1, the almanac and the page-25 summaries, and the ionosphere/UTC, special-message, NMCT and
received-pages tables.

### Satellites & orbits
Sky plot with tracks, elevation over time, sub-satellite points, satellite position/velocity/clock at the
selected epoch, and the IS-GPS-200 orbit computation step by step (including each Kepler iteration).

![Satellites and orbits](docs/screenshots/15_Satellites__orbits.png)

### Pseudoranges
Every correction applied to each pseudorange at the selected epoch, with pseudorange change, post-fit residuals,
code-minus-carrier, measured vs predicted Doppler, tropospheric delay and satellite clock correction over time.

![Pseudoranges](docs/screenshots/16_Pseudoranges.png)

### Position
**Summary & plots:** mean position, accuracy statistics, horizontal scatter with CEP/2DRMS circles, E/N/U
error, receiver clock bias and drift, DOP, satellites used, and Doppler velocity.

![Position - summary and plots](docs/screenshots/17_Position_Summary__plots.png)

**Solutions:** every epoch's fix (geodetic, ECEF, ENU, clock, DOP, velocity, residual RMS), exportable to CSV/KML.

![Position - solutions](docs/screenshots/18_Position_Solutions.png)

**Least-squares detail:** every Gauss–Newton iteration from the Earth's centre to convergence, the design
matrix and residuals, and the cofactor matrix in the local E/N/U/clock frame.
