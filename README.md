# Software GPS Receiver (Qt)

A post-processing GPS L1 C/A and Galileo E1 receiver for recorded IF sample files. It is built to show every
step of the signal processing: raw-signal statistics, C/A code generation, acquisition, tracking loops, bit
synchronisation, navigation-message decoding with parity or CRC, ephemeris/almanac/health, satellite orbits,
pseudoranges, and the least-squares position/velocity/time solution. GPS and Galileo can be used alone or
combined in one fix.

## Building and running in Qt Creator

1. Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator (*File > Open File or Project*).
2. Select the **Desktop Qt 6.12.0 MinGW 64-bit** kit.
3. Choose the **Release** build configuration and press **Run** (Ctrl+R).
   Debug builds also work: the DSP core (`gnsscore`) is optimised even in Debug
   (option `GNSS_OPTIMIZE_CORE_IN_DEBUG`), so only the GUI is unoptimised.
4. On first start the program looks for a large `*.bin` file in the working directory and up to five levels above
   the executable, so `GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin` is opened automatically. Otherwise use
   *File > Open*. After that the last file is reopened.
5. Press **F5** (*Run all*), or run the stages one at a time with F6 (acquire), F7 (track), F8 (decode) and F9 (solve).

The sampling frequency, IF and sample format come from the file name (`fs38_192` = 38.192 MHz,
`if9_55` = 9.55 MHz, int8 real samples by default, packed 2-bit real samples if the name contains `2bit`). You can
change them in *File > Settings*, along with every acquisition, tracking-loop and navigation parameter.

*File > Settings* also selects **GPS + Galileo**, **GPS only** or **Galileo only**. Searching for Galileo adds several
seconds to acquisition, so choose GPS only for a recording made before Galileo was operating.

The file name gives the IF rounded to 9.55 MHz. The true IF of this recording is fs/4 = 9.548 MHz. The receiver
copes either way, and the Position page reports the measured *effective IF* (9.547984 MHz) from the
Doppler/clock-drift solution. If you set the IF to 9.548 MHz, the Doppler values are shown without the
2 kHz offset.

## Editing the GUI in Qt Designer

Every page, the main window and the settings dialog are `.ui` forms in `src/gui/`:

| Form | Content |
|---|---|
| `MainWindow.ui` | menus, toolbar, log dock, and the tab widget holding all pages (each tab is a promoted page widget) |
| `SettingsDialog.ui` | input, acquisition, tracking and navigation settings |
| `OverviewPage.ui` | recording info, pipeline status, satellite summary, position summary, algorithm documentation |
| `RawSignalPage.ui` | time-domain samples, ADC histogram, Welch PSD, spectrogram, statistics |
| `CaCodePage.ui` | G1/G2/C-A sequences, autocorrelation, cross-correlation, sampled correlation peak, code spectrum, code table |
| `AcquisitionPage.ui` | metric and C/N0 bars, results table, correlation surface heat map, code/Doppler slices, fine-frequency spectrum |
| `TrackingPage.ui` | 12 per-channel loop plots, all-channel overlays, multi-correlator shape, loop design tables |
| `BitSyncPage.ui` | transition histogram, prompt with bit edges, soft bits, preamble correlation, raw bit grid |
| `NavMessagePage.ui` | subframe list, words with parity check, colour-coded bit map, decoded fields with scaling and interpretation |
| `EphemerisPage.ui` | ephemeris table, almanac, health/A-S/configuration, iono/UTC, special message, NMCT, received pages |
| `SatellitesPage.ui` | sky plot, elevation, sub-satellite points, satellite state, step-by-step Kepler computation |
| `MeasurementsPage.ui` | per-epoch pseudorange corrections table, PR change, residuals, code-minus-carrier, Doppler, tropo, SV clock |
| `PositionPage.ui` | summary, scatter/ENU/clock/DOP/velocity plots, solutions table, least-squares iterations, H and Q matrices |

Notes for editing:

* The plots and tables are **promoted widgets**: `gui::PlotWidget` and `gui::SkyPlotWidget` (from `QWidget`) and
  `gui::DataTable` (from `QTableWidget`). You can move, resize, split or regroup them freely.
* Plot titles and axis labels are dynamic properties of the promoted widget (`title`, `xLabel`, `yLabel`, plus
  `aspectLocked` and `legendVisible`). Edit them in the Property Editor. Some titles are replaced at run time
  with PRN-specific text.
* Keep the **objectName** of any control the code uses (e.g. `channelCombo`, `epochSpin`, `surfacePlot`). The code
  accesses them as `ui->name`.
* Table **column headers are set in code** (`setColumns(...)` in each page's constructor), because the code fills
  the table by column index. Change the header list and the matching `setNum/setText` column numbers together.
* The combo boxes in `SettingsDialog.ui` list their items in enum order (sample format, Doppler sign, constellations). Keep that order.

Plot interaction: mouse wheel zooms (Ctrl = x only, Shift = y only), left-drag box-zooms, right-drag pans,
double-click resets, and right-click opens a menu (copy/save image, export CSV, legend, grid). The tracking-page
time axes are linked. Tables support Ctrl+C and *Export to CSV* from the context menu.

## Command line

```

## Results for the sample recording

`GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin` is 50.08 s of 4-bit-quality int8 real samples.

* 9 satellites acquired (PRN 3, 6, 9, 15, 18, 21, 22, 26, 29). All tracked with 100 % phase lock at 42–51 dB-Hz.
* 63 subframes decoded, 630/630 words pass parity, and all 9 ephemerides complete and consistent.
* 99 fixes (every 0.5 s): **40.00802° N, 105.26270° W, h = 1634 m** (Boulder, Colorado), with σ E/N/U =
  1.95/2.08/3.27 m and PDOP 1.65.
* GPS week 297 (mod 1024), i.e. 2005-05-07 19:10 UTC.
* Sample clock error +10.4 ppb (clock-bias slope 3.1 m/s). Effective IF 9.547984 MHz.
* Subframe 4 page 18 (ionosphere/UTC) is broadcast every 12.5 min and is not in this 50-s recording, so no
  ionospheric correction is applied (residual RMS ≈ 5 m).

Processing the whole file takes about 13 s on a 12-core CPU: acquisition 2 s, tracking 9 s with one thread per channel.
With Galileo enabled, the search for it adds several seconds to acquisition.

## Results with Galileo

The GPS-only recordings above cannot exercise Galileo. The test recording is `IFEN_Bands-L1.stream` from the
[ION GNSS SDR sample data](https://sdr.ion.org/api-sample-data.html): 18.6 minutes of packed 2-bit real samples at
20.48 MHz with an IF of 5.5 MHz. It is not part of this repository. Save it as
`IFEN_Bands-L1-fs20_48-if5_5-2bit.stream` and those settings are read from the name.

The file's metadata gives 2016-01-19 at a fixed position. The navigation data shows that it was recorded on
2017-02-06, near 48.08 N, 11.64 E, and that the receiver was in a vehicle moving at up to 14 m/s for much of the time.

* 8 GPS and 5 Galileo satellites acquired (E02, E08, E19, E20, E30). E1-B and E1-C agree on delay and Doppler for all five.
* 1860 of 2046 I/NAV words pass the CRC, with no TOW inconsistencies. The failures come from lost tracking, mostly late
  in the recording, not from random errors.
* E20 broadcasts only dummy words (type 63), so it is tracked and decoded but gives no ephemeris. The other four share
  IODnav 91.

For the first 58 s, while the vehicle is stationary:

| Satellites | Latitude | Longitude | Height | std E/N/U | PDOP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 GPS | 48.0781398 | 11.6383598 | 601.73 m | 1.83 / 2.18 / 6.53 m | 1.88 |
| 4 Galileo | 48.0781221 | 11.6383477 | 598.52 m | 1.77 / 2.98 / 1.85 m | 2.28 |
| 8 GPS + 4 Galileo | 48.0781303 | 11.6383537 | 600.19 m | 1.44 / 2.00 / 4.24 m | 1.39 |

The two independent solutions agree to about 3 m. The Galileo-GPS bias is 2.0 m, in line with the broadcast time offset of
3.8 ns plus the different receiver delays of the two signals. Comparing the Galileo-only and GPS-only tracks epoch by epoch
over the first 710 s, including driving, gives a mean difference of less than 1 m horizontally and 3.6 m vertically, and RMS
differences of 2.8 m east and 3.4 m north. Galileo-only fixes are available for about 1000 of those 1420 epochs.

After about 710 s every satellite weakens at once, at all elevations, most likely from obstructions along the route, and the
weakest signals are lost. No Galileo-only fix is possible from then on: of the Galileo satellites only E30 and E20 stay
tracked, and E20 has no ephemeris. The receiver has no outlier rejection, so the GPS and combined solutions then show 60 to
80 jumps of up to about 100 m. There are none before that point.

The whole recording takes about 3 minutes on a 12-core CPU and 6.5 GB of memory, most of it for the per-epoch tracking
history. Limit *Data to process* for a quicker run.
